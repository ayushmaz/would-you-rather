# Would You Rather Project

This is the second project of my Udacity's React Nanodegree program.
This is basically a SPA(single page application) built using ReactJS where users can upload a poll consisting of two options and also answer other polls 
uploaded by other user.
The app also contains a leaderboard and the score for each user depends on number of question asked and answered.

# Tech stack
- ReactJS
- Redux (state management)
